          Eduonix introduces it's biggest and best course yet! To cater to the
          changing role of developers and technologies around the world, we have
          introduced a brand new master course to become a Full Stack Web
          Developer. With the fast paced nature of technology, developers can no
          longer become experts in aspects of development, but now must learn
          the entire process of development from design to actual deployment.
          This has introduced a new role for developers - Full Stack Developers.
          What are Full Stack Developers? Full Stack Developers are developers
          that design complete apps and websites. These developers work on all
          facets of development, from frontend, to backend, to database and even
          debugging and testing. In short, the developer must understand the app
          through and through. Frontend developers are more sought after because
          of their expertise of not in one but multiple technologies. They can
          handle all aspects of development, and it can result in a more
          seamlessly created product. However, resources to become a Full Stack
          Developer are limited and only offer sections or just random
          technologies that you must learn and combine on your own. So, we
          introduced this course that compiles all technologies in perfect sync
          to help developers transition from a simple developer to become a Full
          Stack Developer. Starting from frontend development, the learner will
          slowly progress to become to other aspects of development including
          backend, database, debugging, version control and other essential
          technologies that are helpful for a developer. Our Full Stack Course
          breaks down the fundamentals of each technology that you would require
          to become a Full Stack Developer. The entire course is broken down
          into five separate segments: Frontend, Backend, Database, Other
          Essential Technologies and Debugging/Version Control. Each section
          includes multiple technologies to help you gain more experience as a
          developer. That's not it! In addition to theory based learning, the
          course also focuses on practical applications by covering multiple
          projects in great detail, helping you learn with hands-on experience.
